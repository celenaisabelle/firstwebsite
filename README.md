This is my first repository which specializes in front-end software development. Experimenting with different coding languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with basics in React, Bootstrap, and Node.js.

I am also learning Git features such as push, fetch, commit, version control, and the importance of commit messages.
